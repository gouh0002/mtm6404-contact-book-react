# Contact Book

This is a simple contact book web application built using **React**, **React Router**, and **Firebase Firestore**.

## Features

- View all contacts
- Search by first or last name
- View full contact details
- Add a new contact
- Edit existing contacts
- Delete a contact

All data is stored in **Firestore**, inside a collection called `contacts`.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router DOM
- Firebase (Firestore)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vite

## What I Learned

This project helped me practice:
- Using React functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Creating routes with React Router
- Connecting a frontend app to Firebase
- Fetching and managing real-time data from Firestore
- Handling forms in React

## Installation (for testing)

To run the project locally:
npm install
npm run dev

## Objective
Use what you have learned about React, React Router, and Firestore to create a contact book web application, which allows a user to see and search through all contacts, add new contacts, and edit and delete existing contacts.
